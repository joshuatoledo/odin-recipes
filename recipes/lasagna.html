<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a classic lasagna recipe with layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
  <li>2 pounds sweet Italian sausage</li>
  <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
  <li>1 cup minced onion</li>
  <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
  <li>2 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>4 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
  <li>4 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  <li>8 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon salt, divided, or to taste</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  <li>24 lasagna noodles</li>
  <li>2 pounds ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>2 egg</li>
  <li>1 ½ pounds mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
  <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
  <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
  <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
  <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
  <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
  <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
